## Description

Repository contains Admin Area as SPA and require API (with some data).

## Technologies

The project assumes you are familiar with:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs)
- [Vue 3.x](https://vuejs.org/guide/)
- [Vuex 4.x](https://vuex.vuejs.org/)
- [Vuetify 3](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/getting-started/quick-start)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)

## Getting started

### Run project

1. Run API with db
2. Verify you meet node requirements:
   1. The project runs successfully on Node version 18.16.0+
3. Install dependencies
  ```sh
  npm i
  ```
4. Run
  ```sh
  npm run dev
  ```
#### Docker

Refer to [Run with Docker Containers](docker/README.md#run-with-docker-containers)

#### Code Conventions


```sh
npm run lint
```

Format code

```sh
npm run format

```

Format MD files

```sh
npm run lint:md
```

Notes:

- includes 'Table of Content' generation for each md document
- [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md) file has own format, see info inside

## Build

Build project by running

```sh
npm run build
```

This command flashes your project and saves the files to the [dist](./dist/) folder

## Deployment

Refer to [Deployment README](docker/README.md) for Docker build, run, and deploy.

## Versioning

- Every [release](#release) is versioned with
  [semver](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)
- Every build is versioned with
  [`git describe`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-describe#_examples) to have distinct info
- In case `git describe` is not available (e.g. gitlab CI has tree history limit for 50
  items) describe-like fallback is used: `v${semver}-50+g${commit}`;

## API Clients

The project uses 2 types of API clients/DTO classes:

1. Custom developed (Client - [CrudEndpoint](src/api/common/CrudEndpoint.ts), DTO
   classes - `src\api\dto`)

### API Clients Roadmap

1. Some entities are using `CrudEndpoint` clients
2. Should be replaced with Autogenerated Clients

### Update Autogenerated Client

- Info about client generation - TBD
- On request from backend developer - see _OpenAPI diff_ in `swagger.json` and copy
  [generated clients file](https://gitlab.com/path/to/typescript/AdminApiClient.auto.ts)
  to the repository

## Table Component

Approach to speed-up and re-use working with CRUD entities.

Refer to [docs](./docs/TableComponent.md) for full instructions on how to create new
Entity and custom component to display a list of items in Table view.
